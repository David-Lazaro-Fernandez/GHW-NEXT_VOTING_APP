## Description

Welcome to the Voting App project! Doge, the charismatic candidate, is running for president and needs your help to beat his rival, Long Long Johnson. To achieve this, Doge requires a robust Voting System to understand the opinions of the people in the country about him üó≥.

## Libraries

Doge's tech team says that using this would work üêï‚Äçü¶∫:

- **Next.js**: The lead hound in our pack, Next.js, helps us build server-side rendering and static web applications that are as agile as a Greyhound.
- **Upstash**: This clever retriever helps us manage and store our data efficiently, fetching only what's needed to keep our app running smoothly.
- **Shadcn/ui**: Our UI guide dog, Shadcn/ui, ensures the app's interface is visually appealing and user-friendly, leading users effortlessly through the voting process.
- **Lucid React**: With the agility of a Border Collie, Lucid React assists with awesome icons for our app.
- **WordMap**: With this bone, we could track all the opinions of all the people in the country and come to a great conclusion regarding the Doge candidate.
